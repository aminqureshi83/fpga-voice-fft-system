# fpga-voice-fft-system
This project implements a real-time voice signal acquisition, FFT processing, and frequency-domain visualization system using FPGA hardware. The system captures audio through an I2S microphone interface, processes the signal using FFT algorithms, and displays frequency components on a color LCD via SPI communication.
